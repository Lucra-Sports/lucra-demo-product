# iOS App

This directory contains the iOS client for the baseline RNG product. By
default the application sends requests to the remote server at
<http://playrng.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com>.

## Running the App

1. Open `RNGApp.xcodeproj` in **Xcode**.
2. Choose a simulator or a connected device.
3. Press **Run** (or use `Cmd + R`) to build and launch the app.

The server URL can be modified in code if necessary, but the default
configuration targets the remote server above.
