# Android App

This module contains the Android client for the baseline RNG product. By
default it communicates with the remote server at
<http://playrng.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com>.

## Running the App

1. Open the `product-base/android-app` directory in **Android Studio**
   (`File` â†’ `Open`).
2. Let Gradle synchronize and download any required dependencies.
3. Select a device or emulator.
4. Press **Run** to build and launch the application.

The server URL can be modified in code if needed, but out of the box it points
to the remote server above.
